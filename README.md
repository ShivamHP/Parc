# Parc
A Parking app made for DevSoc hackathon

## Purpose of this app  
1)This app was designed to aid the parking authorities. It makes their work simpler by eradicating the use of paper and reducing the process down to a few clicks.  
2)The other important purpose of this app is to maintain a proper and unaltered digital record of every vehicle coming in and out. The app saves the vehicle number and the entry-exity times of each and every vehicle by using timestamps.

##Functionality 
-The parking assistants have to save the vehicle number and a photo of all the vehicles which come in.
-By using timestamps, the entry and exit times of the vehicles will be recorded.
-With the help of an algorithm, the app calculates the amount to be paid by the client. This greatly reduces the work of the parking assistants. It can also help us save resources.
